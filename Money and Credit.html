				<p><b>1.What is the meaning of ‘barter system’?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Barter system refers to the system of exchange of goods and services. It is the system by which one commodity is exchanged for another without the use of money. Before money was introduced, people practised barter system.<br>
                Example: A farmer could buy a dhoti from a weaver or a pair of shoes from a cobbler in exchange of grains he produced.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>2.What is the meaning of ‘investment’?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Investment is buying of an asset in the form of a factory, a machine, land and building, etc. (physical assets) or shares (monetary assets) for the purpose of making or sharing profits of the enterprises concerned.
				Common investments are—buying land, factories, machines for faster production, buying small local companies to expand production, cheap labour, skilled engineers, IT personnel, etc.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>3.Which country has successfully organized SHGs? Who had initiated the programme?</b><br>
				<b>Answer</b>Bangladesh has successfully organized SHGs. Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is the biggest success story in reaching the poor to meet their credit needs at reasonable rates. Grameen Bank has now over 6 million borrowers in 40,000 villages across Bangladesh. Most of the borrowers are women and belong to the poorest section of society. This idea is the brain child of Prof. Mohammad Yunus, recipient of 2006 Nobel Prize for Peace.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>4.What is collateral? Why do lenders ask for collateral while lending? Explain.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Collateral is an asset that the borrower owns (land, building, vehicle, livestock, land documents, deposits with banks etc.) which stands as a security against the money borrowed. In case the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the right to sell the asset or collateral to recover the loan money. Most lenders ask for collateral while lending as a security against their own funds.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>5.Why is it necessary for the banks and cooperative societies to increase their lending facilities in rural areas? Explain.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Banks and Cooperatives can help people in obtaining cheap and affordable loans. This will help people to grow crops, do business, set up small-scale industries or trade in goods and also help indirectly in the country’s development. They should do so, so that relatively poor people do not have to depend on informal sources of credit (money-lenders).</p><br><br><br><br>

			    <p><B>Long Answer Type Questions</B></p><br><br><br>
				<p><b>1.How do banks play an important role in the economy of India?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>(i)Banks help people to save their money and keep their money in safe custody. To ensure safety of their money, people deposit  their money with banks. Banks accept deposits and pay interest on deposits. People have the provision to withdraw their money as and when they require.<br>
				       (ii)Banks also grant loans to people for a variety of purposes. In times of need individuals, business houses and industries can borrow money from the banks.<br>
					   (iii)Credit provided by banks is crucial for the country’s growth and economic development. Credit is needed for all kinds of economic activities, to set up business, buy cars, houses, etc.<br>
					   (iv)Banks also help people in obtaining cheap and affordable loans. This can help people to grow crops, do business, set up small-scale industries or trade in goods and also help indirectly in the country’s development. They should do so, so that relatively poor people do not have to depend on informal sources of credit (money-lenders).</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>2.Why do we need to expand formal sources of credit in India?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>(i)There is no organisation that supervises the credit activities of lenders in the informal sector. They lend at 
				        whatever interest rate they choose.<br>
				       (ii)No one can stop rural money-lenders from using unfair means to get their money back.<br>
					   (iii)Informal lenders charge a very high rate of interest on loans and as a result a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers and farmers are used to pay the loans.<br>
					   (iv)The amount to be repaid is often greater than income, and farmers and other borrowers in villages fall in a debt trap.<br>
					   Thus, it is necessary that banks and co-operatives increase their lending, particularly in rural areas, so that dependence on informal sources of credit ends.</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>3.Which government body supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans in India? Explain its functioning.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>The Reserve Bank of India supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans. Functions of Reserve Bank of India.:<br>
				       (i)RBI requires commercial banks to maintain a minimum cash balance out of the deposits they receive. The RBI monitors that the banks actually maintain the cash balance.<br>
					   (ii)RBI sees that the banks give loans not just to profit-making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators, small-scale industries, small borrowers, SHGs, etc.<br>
					   (iii)RBI issues guidelines for fixing rate of interest on deposits and lending by commercial banks.<br>
					   (iv)Periodically, banks have to submit information to the RBI on how much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rate, etc.<br></p><br><br><br><br>
