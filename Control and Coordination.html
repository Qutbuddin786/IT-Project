				<p><b>1.Define reflex arc.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>The pathway taken by the nerve impulses in a reflex action, from receptor organ to spinal cord and back to effector organ of reflex action is called reflex arc. Receptor organ could be a sense organ such as eyes, skin, etc., and effector organ could be muscles, glands, etc.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>2.Mentioh three major regions of brain. Write one function of each.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Brain is divided into three main regions forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain:<br>
				(i) Forebrain consists of cerebrum, olfactory lobes and diencephalon. Its main function is thinking and controlling various activities such as touch, smell, hearing, speech and sight.<br>
				(ii) Midbrain controls reflex movements of the head, neck and trunk in response to visual and auditory stimuli.<br>
				(iii) Hindbrain has three centres called pons, cerebellum and medulla. This part is responsible for regulating respiration, maintaining posture and balance of body and controlling involuntary actions such as heartbeat, breathing, swallowing, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, etc.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>3.What is meant by tropic movements?</b><br>
				<b>Answer</b>Directional movements or orientations of specific part of a plant in response to external stimuli are called tropisms or tropic movements.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>4.Define geotropism.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Geotropism refers to the upward and downward growth of shoots and roots respectively in response to the pull of earth or gravity. If the plant part moves in the direction of gravity, it is called positive geotropism. Likewise, if the plant part moves against the direction of gravity, it is termed as negative geotropism. Shoots are usually negatively geotropic and roots are usually positively geotropic.<p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>5.Define phototropism. Name the plant hormone which is responsible for phototropism. </b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Phototropism is the movement of a part of the plant in response to light. Shoots generally grow towards light and are said to be positively phototropic, while roots grow away from light and are said to be negatively phototropic. The growth movement of the plant part (stem) is caused by the action of auxin hormone. Auxin causes cell elongation. Thus, causing growth of stem towards the light stimulus.</p><br><br><br><br>

				<p><b>1.“Reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses”. Justify this statement giving reason.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Reflex action is an automatic and spontaneous response to a stimulus. The pathway taken by nerve impulses and responses in a reflex action is called a reflex arc. It consists of receptor, sensory nerve (afferent), spinal cord, motor nerve (efferent) and effector (muscles or glands). Reflex arc is evolved in animals because the thinking process of the brain is not fast enough. Reflex arc enables the body to give quick responses to harmful stimuli so that chances of damage to body are decreased. It also prevents overloading of brain, so prevents its fatigue. Many animals have very little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So, it is likely that reflex arc has evolved as an efficient way of functioning in the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex neuron networks have came into existence, reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses.</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>2.Why does the flow of signals in a synapse from axonal end of one neuron to dendritic end of another neuron take place but not in the reverse direction? Explain.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>At the synapse, (functional junction between neurons) axon terminal comes in close proximity to the dendron terminal of next neuron. Axon terminal is expanded to form pre-synaptic knob and the other dendrite terminal forms post- synaptic depression. In between the two, lies a narrow fluid filled space called synaptic cleft. As the nerve impulse reaches the pre-synaptic knob, the synaptic vesicles get stimulated to release neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the gap to come in contact with post-synaptic membrane. In this way, nerve impulse passes across the minute gap to stimulate dendron of other neuron. The synapse acts as a one-way valve to conduct impulse in one direction only. This is so because chemical substance called neurotransmitter is secreted only on one side of the gap, i.e., on axon’s side. It carries impulse across the synapse and passes it to the dendron of the other neuron. In this way, impulses travel across the neurons only in one direction, i.e., from axon of one neuron to dendron of other neuron through a synapse.</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>3.(a)What are phytohormones? Where are these hormones synthesised?<br>
				        (b)What happens when a growing plant detects light? Explain in brief.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>(a)Phytohormones are chemical substances produced naturally in plants and are capable of translocation and regulating one or more physiological processes when present in low concentration. Plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. Plant hormones are also known as plant growth substances or plant growth regulators.<br>
				(b)Plants respond to light by showing growth movement towards light (phototropism). This growth movement of the plant part (stem) is caused by the action of auxin hormone. The auxin hormone is synthesised in the meristematic tissue at the tip of the stem. Auxin diffuses uniformly down the stem in plants that are kept in the open and receive sunlight from above. Due to presence of auxin equally on both the sides, the stem grows up straight because both the sides of the stem show growth at the same place. But when sunlight is unidirectional, auxin- gets accumulated towards the shady region of (he shoot. This causes the cells to elongate and stem to bend towards light.</p><br><br><br><br>
