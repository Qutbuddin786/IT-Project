				<p><b>1.What is DNA copying? State its importance.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>DNA copying is the production of similar copies of DNA present in a cell using various chemical reactions. DNA copying is essential for reproduction through which the organisms pass on their body features to their offspring. Moreover, minor alternations during the process of DNA copying result in the production of variations. Such variations are useful for the survival of species over time.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>2.Define reproduction. How does it helps in providing stability to the population of species?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>The production of new organisms by the existing organisms of the same species is known as reproduction. It is linked to the stability of population of a species. DNA replication during reproduction ensures transfer of specific characters or body design features that is essential for an individual of a population to live and use that particular niche. Some variations present in a few individuals of population caused due to reproduction which also helps in their survival at changing niches.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>3.How do Plasmodium and Leishmania reproduce? Write one difference in their mode of reproduction.</b><br>
				<b>Answer</b>Plasmodium and Leishmania reproduce by the process of fission which is an asexual mode of reproduction. Plasmodium reproduces by multiple fission. About 1000 daughter cells are produced by the multiple fission of a Plasmodium. Leishmania reproduces by the process of binary fission. In Leishmania, the splitting of parent cell takes place in a definite plane (longitudinally) with respect to flagellum at its end to produce two daughter cells.</p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>4.What is multiple fission? How does it occur in an organism? Explain briefly. Name one organism which exhibits this type of reproduction.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Multiple fission refers to the process of asexual reproduction in which many individuals are formed from a single parent. This method of reproduction occurs in unfavourable conditions. The unicellular organism develops a protective covering called cyst, over the cell. The nucleus of the cell divides repeatedly producing many nuclei. Later on, each nucleus is surrounded by small amount of cytoplasm and many daughter cells are produced within the cyst. When conditions are favourable the cyst breaks and small offspring are liberated. This type of reproduction is seen in some protozoans, e.g., malarial parasite (Plasmodium).<p><br><br>
				
				<p><b>5.Explain the process of regeneration in Planaria. How is this process different from reproduction?</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Planaria possesses great power of regeneration. If the body of Planaria somehow gets cut into a number of pieces, then each body piece can regenerate into a complete Planaria by growing all the missing parts. During the process of reproduction, new organism is formed from the complete parent organism. However, during fragmentation, a fragment of original parent body grows into new individual.</p><br><br><br><br>

				<p><b>1.State the basic requirement for sexual reproduction. Write the importance of such reproductions in nature.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>The basic requirement for sexual reproduction is involvement of both sexes, i.e., male and female, to produce an offspring. It takes place by the combination of gametes which come from two different parents.<br>
                The importance of sexual reproduction in nature are :<br>
				       (i) Fusion of male and female gametes coming from two different and sexually distinct individuals, exhibit diversity of characters in offspring.<br>
					   (ii) Meiosis during gametogenesis provides opportunities for new combination of genes, which leads to variation required for evolution and plays a prominent role in the origin of new species. Variations lead to the appearance of such characters, which fit to the changing environment, resulting in the survival of the species.</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>2.What is vegetative propagation? List with brief explanation three advantages of practising this process for growing some types of plants. Select two plants from the following which are grown by this process : Banana, Wheat, Mustard, Jasmine, Gram.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>Vegetative propagation is an asexual method of reproduction in plants. In this method, new plants are obtained from the parts of old plants (like stems, roots and leaves), without the help of any reproductive organs.<br>
				Advantages of vegetative propagation are as follows:<br>
				       (i)Vegetative propagation is usually used for the propagation of those plants which produce either very few seeds or do not produce viable seeds.<br>
					   (ii)Grafting is a propagation method which is very useful for fruit trees and flowering bushes. It enables to combine the most desirable characteristics of two plants.<br>
					   (iii)Plants like rose, sugarcane, cactus, etc., can be rapidly propagated through stem cuttings as this method produces new plants from just one plant quickly without waiting for flowers and seeds. Banana and jasmine are generally grown through vegetative propagation method.</p><br><br>
					   
				<p><b>3.List four advantages of vegetative propagation.</b><br>
				<b>Answer:</b>The following are the advantages of vegetative propagation:<br>
				       (i)The characters of the parent plants are preserved hence a good variety produced can be propagated by vegetative means.<br>
					   (ii)The plants, which do not produce viable seeds or produce very few seeds, can be reproduced by this method. For example, banana, potato, grapes, sugarcane, rose, orange, etc.<br>
					   (iii)It is an easier, quicker and cheaper method of propagation.<br>
					   (iv)It is easier to get rid of pathogen from any part of plant by vegetative propagation</p><br><br><br><br>
